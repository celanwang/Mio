## Description:

Tencent Ride Skill helps an agent handle ride-hailing requests, address confirmation, fare estimates, order placement, order lookup, cancellation, driver-location lookup, and first-use token and resident-city setup.

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use.

## Publisher:

[tencent-adm](https://clawhub.ai/user/tencent-adm)

### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

External users use this skill through an agent to request Tencent ride-hailing assistance, including route setup, fare checks, booking, order status checks, cancellation, and driver-location queries. The skill is intended for real ride workflows where addresses, prices, and order details must come from the provided Tencent service tools.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: The skill can store a Tencent ride token and saved places locally.

Mitigation: Use it only on trusted machines, avoid exposing real tokens in visible command history or logs, and clear the token when the machine is shared or managed.

Risk: The skill can send precise pickup, dropoff, order, and driver-location data to Tencent endpoints.

Mitigation: Confirm addresses and ride intent before tool execution, and treat generated map URLs and order details as sensitive.

Risk: The skill can place or cancel ride orders.

Mitigation: Review booking and cancellation steps carefully before deployment and require explicit user confirmation for transaction-changing actions.

Risk: Broad ride-hailing triggers may activate the skill for general travel or commute requests.

Mitigation: Keep routing boundaries clear so non-ride tasks, unrelated navigation requests, and unsupported services are redirected instead of acted on.
